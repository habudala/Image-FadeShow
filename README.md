### I came up with a simple way to create a fade in image "slide" show. 

#### This is one of the results of my experiments creating a slideshow without using any frameworks/libraries but the essentials. This is a very simple (no controls) way to recreate the same effect that otherwise would require the download or attachment of a third party library. This way, only jQuery is required.
